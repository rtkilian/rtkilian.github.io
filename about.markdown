Hi, I'm Rhys Kilian. Currently, I'm working as a Data Scientist at [Movember](https://movember.com/) where I run experiments and develop models (e.g. customer segmentation, churn prediction) to improve the face of men's health. 

In the past, I worked as a Management Consultant at [Kearney](https://www.kearney.com/analytics) where I consulted with several ASX200 companies across retail, telecommunications and logistics. During my time, I developed a NLP model to classify spend items on invoices for a fuel and convenience retailer, created a ML model to forecast the performance of a telecommunications network, and developed a non-linear optimisation model to minimise the net cost of a high-spend category for a telecommunications provider.

I am a graduate of the University of Sydney with First Class Honours in Mechanical Engineering (Honours) and Commerce (Business Analytics). I completed my Honours thesis on more accurately predicting the flow of water in rivers by embedding a deep learning model in a Computational Fluid Dynamic (CFD) simulation.
