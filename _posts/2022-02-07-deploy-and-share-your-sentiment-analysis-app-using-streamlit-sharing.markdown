Imagine this, youâ€™ve spent the last two weeks developing a killer sentiment analysis model on your local machine. Youâ€™ve experimented with five different models, tuned your hyperparameters to perfection and tested the performance on a range of scenarios.

But now a non-technical Product Manager wants to review your model. What do you do?

You could run a live demo? Your calendars donâ€™t line up for weeks.
You could share your virtual environment? They donâ€™t know how to code.
You could get a developer to deploy the model? Their task list is two weeks long.

Unfortunately, this is a scenario that many Data Scientists find themselves in. **But thanks to [Streamlit Sharing](https://streamlit.io/sharing) you can now deploy and share your model in less than 30-minutes without help from a developer.**

## The Goal of this Tutorial
In this tutorial, I will show you how to deploy a [sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) model using Streamlit Sharing. A user will be able to enter their text and the model will classify it as â€˜POSITIVEâ€™ or â€˜NEGATIVEâ€™ sentiment, along with a confidence score.

To see a **live demo** of my application on Streamlit Sharing: [click here](https://share.streamlit.io/rtkilian/streamlit-huggingface/main/sentiment_analyser.py).
To view my **source code** on GitHub: [click here](https://github.com/rtkilian/streamlit-huggingface).

## Step 1: Installing Libraries
### Streamlit
[Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/) is an open-source Python library that makes it easy to create and share beautiful, custom web apps for machine learning and data science.

To install:
{% highlight python %}
pip install streamlit
{% endhighlight %}

You should also request an invitation for [**Streamlit Sharing**](https://streamlit.io/sharing) which allows you to deploy, manage, and share your apps with the world, directly from Streamlit.

It may take up to 2-days to receive your invitation. However, I received my invitation within 24-hours, even after requesting it on the weekend.

### ðŸ¤— Transformers by Hugging Face
[ðŸ¤— Transformers](https://huggingface.co/transformers/) provides general-purpose architectures (BERT, GPT-2, etc.) for Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Natural Language Generation (NLG) with over 32+ pre-trained models in 100+ languages. In only a few lines of code, you can have a state of the art sentiment analysis model downloaded and ready to go.

First, you need to install one of, or both, TensorFlow 2.0 and PyTorch. Please refer to the [TensorFlow installation](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip#tensorflow-2.0-rc-is-available) page and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/#start-locally) installation page regarding the specific install command for your platform.

When installed, run the following command:
{% highlight python %}
pip install transformers
{% endhighlight %}

## Step 2: Project Set-Up
All your code will need to be contained within a Python file (.py). I personally use Visual Studio Code that comes installed in Anaconda, however, you can also download your Jupyter Notebook as a .py file.

Iâ€™ve called my file **sentiment_analyser.py**.

Now, import the libraries you downloaded in Step 1:
{% highlight python %}
import streamlit as st
from transformers import pipeline
{% endhighlight %}

In the same directory, create a text file called **requirements.txt** and copy the version of the libraries you installed in Step 1. When it comes time to deploy your app, Streamlit Sharing will install the libraries in this file.
{% highlight python %}
streamlit==0.86
transformers==4.8.1
torch==1.9.0
{% endhighlight %}

At this point, you should also create a **GitHub repo**. If youâ€™ve never used GitHub before, I recommend checking out their [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo) to set up your first repo.

## Step 3: Create the User Interface Using Streamlit
Finally, something fun! We will now start by creating the structure of your Streamlit web application.

First, letâ€™s add a title and some descriptive text by adding the following code to your **sentiment_analyser.py** file:
{% highlight python %}
st.title('Sentiment Analyser App')
st.write('Welcome to my sentiment analysis app!')
{% endhighlight %}

To run your app locally (before we deploy it), navigate to your development directory in your terminal and run the following command:
{% highlight python %}
streamlit run sentiment_analyser.py
{% endhighlight %}

If all goes to plan, you should have your Streamlit app popping up in a new browser window.

We will now build a simple form that contains a text area for user input and a submit button. Our â€˜*user_input*â€™ variable will be passed into our sentiment analysis model in Step 4.

{% highlight python %}
form = st.form(key='sentiment-form')
user_input = form.text_area('Enter your text')
submit = form.form_submit_button('Submit')
{% endhighlight %}

After refreshing your application, it should now look like this:
