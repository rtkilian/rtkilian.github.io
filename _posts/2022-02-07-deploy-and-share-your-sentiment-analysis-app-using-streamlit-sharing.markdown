Imagine this, you’ve spent the last two weeks developing a killer sentiment analysis model on your local machine. You’ve experimented with five different models, tuned your hyperparameters to perfection and tested the performance on a range of scenarios.

But now a non-technical Product Manager wants to review your model. What do you do?

You could run a live demo? Your calendars don’t line up for weeks.
You could share your virtual environment? They don’t know how to code.
You could get a developer to deploy the model? Their task list is two weeks long.

Unfortunately, this is a scenario that many Data Scientists find themselves in. **But thanks to [Streamlit Sharing](https://streamlit.io/sharing) you can now deploy and share your model in less than 30-minutes without help from a developer.**
